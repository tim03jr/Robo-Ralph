# Robo-Ralph
Similar to a turtle bot. Tracks a user, avoids obstacles, and has a manual control mode.

The folder, Robo_Ralph_Current, contains the final version of the code, Main_Code_v912, that currently runs on the Robo-Ralph robot.
  The rest of the files in that folder are library files that are used by Main_Code_v912 and were not written by me.
  
All of the other folders contain files that set the foundation for Main_Code_v912. These files contain code for the preliminary testing for all aspects of sensor interfacing with the robot: Kinect, Processing, Laptop serial com, Sonar, IR, Power, LED's, switches, motor/encoders, etc. All this was coordintated with Parallax's 8-core chip.
